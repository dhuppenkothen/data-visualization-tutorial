When we talk about *space* in data visualization, we don't mean Outer Space, the universe. We mean 
the layout on a page or a screen, and which parts of your visualization are filled with information, 
versus parts of the screen that aren't. 

Space has been an important concept in arts and data visualization for a long time. It is closely 
tied to the artistic idea of *composition*. Where do I put the elements of my visualization? Which 
areas do I leave deliberately empty? What effect does this have on the viewer?

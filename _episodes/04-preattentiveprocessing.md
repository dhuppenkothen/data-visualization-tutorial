Much of what follows is a summary of the excellent review paper "Attention and Visual Memory in 
Visualization and Computer Graphics" by Healey and Enns ([website][healywebsite] or [PDF][healypdf]). 
There is *lots* more to say about visual perception that I can do here. For more detailed information 
on the topic, and some background on the underlying theories of perception, take a look at the 
website and PDF and the references mentioned in both. Another excellent resource is the book 
"Information Visualization: Perception for Design" by Colin Ware. 
Human perception is a fascinating topic! 

How does the human brain perceive visual information? How do we go from ink on a paper, or pixels on 
a screen to an understanding in our minds? 
It might be easy to assume that whatever light falls into our eyes is perceived and stored by our brains.
This is not true, however! Our eyes and brains are not cameras, passively generating more or less faithful 
reconstructions of reality! Healy and Enns liken visual perception to a *"dynamic and ongoing construction 
project, where the products being built are short-lived models of the external world that are specifically 
designed for the current visually guided tasks of the viewer."*

There does not appear to be general-purpose vision! Instead, what we perceive when we are confronted with 
a scene depends on our goals, our expectations, our state of mind, and where our attention is in any 
given moment. There are tasks that we can perform in less than the blink of an eye (quite literally!), and 
there are things that we are equally just entirely blind to without expending a significant amoutn of mental 
effort. Designing a visualization is not simply a matter of choosing shapes and colours: it becomes 
the task of working *with* your viewer's minds to help them make sense of the most important information 
you are trying to convey. The goal is to work with our brains' strengths to guide the viewer's attention, 
and make sure the brain's weaknesses do not impede understanding.

This leads to a number of important questions to think about when designing a visualization:

Thankfully, our brains are pretty amazing, and there are a range of strengths of visual cognition, the 
science of how we perceive things with our eyes, to help viewers understand our visualization.

### Pre-Attentive Processing

There are a number of visual tasks that the brain can perform *incredibly* fast. Initially, researchers 
believed that these tasks happen as soon as the eye takes in an image or a scene, before our attention is 
directed anywhere. More recent work suggests, however, that attention plays a crucial role in all visual 
perception, and that we can miss important elements in a scene when our attention is directed away from 
them (more on that below). 

In this sense, the term "pre-attentive processing" is a bit of a misnomer, but has stuck around for its 
descriptiveness. More generally, researchers consider a task pre-attentive if a viewer can 
perform the task in large, multi-component displays of information in less than 200-250 milliseconds 
(this is really short!).

As an example, consider the two figures below, taking from [Healy & Enns, 2012][healypdf] (Figure 1). 
Which of the two contains a red dot?

![two-panel plot, the left side contains only blue dots, the right panel contains blue dots as well as a single red dot]({{ page.root }}/fig/preattentive1.png)

For most of you, the answer was probably fairly obvious. The red dot (called the "target") "pops out" 
at us from the sea of blue dots (also called "distractor").. 
We don't need to think about it, and we don't need to search each dot until we find the right one. The 
red dot is just *there*. This is pre-attentive processing at work, and colour is a strong pre-attentive 
feature. 

We can repeat the same experiment with shapes (from the same figure). Which of the following two panels 
contains a red dot?

![A plot with two panels, the left one contains red squares, the right one red squares and a single red dot]({{ page.root }}/fig/preattentive2.png)

Again, many people can perform that task reasonably quickly, without having to search through every shape 
until they find the circle. The circle is just there, the eyes drawn instinctively. Shape, or more accurately, 
curvature, is a preattentive task. 

There a whole number of pre-attentive features (see also Figure 2 of [Healy & Enns, 2012][healypdf]), among 
them size, orientation, length, density, hue, luminance, intersections, 3D depth, direction of motion, and 
lighting direction. Encoding information using pre-attentive features helps guide our eyes to the most 
important pieces of information in a visualization. For example, if there's a particular data point in your 
scatter plot that is important, give it a different colour to make it pop out!

What happens if you *combine* pre-attentive features? What happens when you're trying to find a red dot 
in a figure filled with red squares and blue circles?
Let's give it a try. In the figure below, which panel has a red dot?

![]({{ page.root }}/fig/preattentive3.png)

If you're anything like me, this was *much* harder and took *much* longer. The reason is that both the 
shape (circle) and the colour are present in the distractors (though not together). Trying to find two 
separate attributes in an ensemble of distractors that contain the same attributes (even though not together) 
is no longer a pre-attentive task. Instead, we have to search through the elements one by one until we 
find the one that matches our target. This requires a lot more time and mental energy. 

One of the cognitive theories aiming to explain pre-attentive processing suggests that similarity plays a
crucial role in finding patterns. The more similar the target and the distractors are, the harder it is 
to pick out the target. But this theory suggests that the similarity between distractors *also* plays a 
role in pre-attentive processing: the more dissimilar distractors are to *each other*, the harder it 
becomes to pick out the target.

We have seen how some attributes make cognition very fast, and how combinations of attributes 
loose this cognitive advantage. How do we use this knowledge in visualization?

### Ensemble Coding

One interesting component of pre-attentive processing is ensemble encoding: it turns out our 
brain can record summary statistics about an ensemble of shapes incredibly quickly, even 
though it wonâ€™t remember the individual elements: for example, consider the figure below with 
circles in blue and green of multiple sizes.
In each of the two panels, are the blue or the green circles larger *on average*?

![two panels, each with green and blue circles in different sizes]({{ page.root }}/fig/preattentive_ensemble.png)


In experiements, viewers can generaelly tell very quickly whether the green or the 
blue circles are, on average, larger, even if they see the figure for just a short moment.
However, they wonâ€™t be able to answer whether any particular circle has a given size, or 
is small or larger than its neighbouring circle. 
Somehow, our brain stores information about the ensemble, without also storing the information 
about each individual member of the ensemble, which seems pretty cool!

## Feature Hierarchy

All right, let's make this a little bit more complex. So far, we have mostly looked at individual features, 
which turned out to be quick to process, ensembles, which also turned out to be quick (unless we care 
about individual elements), and conjunction searches, which are difficult and slow.

But are all types of features equally fast and easy to distinguish? As it turns out, there exists a 
hierarchy. Consider the example below (from [Healy & Enns, 2012][healypdf], Figure 10). Where is the 
boundary between elements?

![two panels, the left with all squares on top, all circles on the bottom, colours randomly chosen for each elements to be either red or blue; the right with all blue to the left, all red to the right, shapes randomly mixed between circles and squares]({{ page.root }}/fig/preattentive_hierarchy.png)] 

In boundary detection, the visual system favours colour over shape. The background variations in colour 
slow down our perception of the edge between the group of circles and the group of squares. This kind 
of task will be slower, but still pre-attentive. The interference of colour with our perception of 
shape is asymmetric: in the right panel, the background variations in shape do not slow down our 
perception of the boundary between blue and red elements nearly as much. What does this mean for 
visualizating data? 

> ## Feature Hierarchies
>
> **Choose the most salient features to encode the most important data attributes.**
>
{: .callout}

For example, researchers have also found preferences for luminance over hue (more on the difference 
between those two in the colour section), and for hue over texture. 

A related concept is *visual interference*. If I display a number of visual features together, will they 
perform as expected? For example, I might make a scatter plot where I encode one attribute of my data 
in the colour, and another, different attribute of my data in shape. Are those patterns equally discernable 
to the viewer? As it turns out, features can intefere with one another, and once again, a hierarchy 
exists: perceptionally strong features like luminance and hue can mask weaker features like curvature.
So when a viewer looks at a figure, they migiht recognize the different colours, but might not pay 
attention to the changes of shape if the latter denote a different axis of information.

## Memory

Guiding the viewer's eye to the most important pieces of information and ensuring these will be 
recognized quickly is only half of the equation. An equally important question is: What will the 
viewer *remember* once they look away? What do we forget? What do we not even notice in the first place?

As we have mentioned above, the brain is extremely selective about what it sees and remembers, which 
turns out to be a small fraction of the information that the light falling into our eyes conveys. 
There are three perceptional concepts that are important to keep in mind for data visualization 
in this context:

1. **Post-attentive amnesia**: Experiments found that having seen an image before for a short while 
offers no help in rapidly identifying the presence of an object when that same image is shown again. 
This is called post-attentive amnesia: we mostly forget what we just saw if we don't already know 
what we're supposed to look out for. However, if a serial search is interrupted, picking that serial 
search up again *is* much faster than starting anew.
2. **Change blindness**: Have you ever looked at one of those puzzles where you compare two images and 
find the differences? In general, they tend to be difficult and time consuming. This is because of a 
cognitive effect called *change blindness*. We cannot remember details of an image across separate scenes
except in areas where viewers have focused their attention. A blink or a blank screen is enough to blind 
us to significant changes that occur in the scene during the interruption. This has important 
implications for multi-panel figures. Because viewers are generally blind to changes between two images, 
even when they are side by side, we must take extra care to direct viewers' attention to the *differences*
between two panels if these turn out to be important to understanding the data.  
3. **Inattentional blindness**: This is one of the most fascinating cognitive effects. While directing 
the viewer's attention to a specific task can help with change blindness, it can at the same time induce 
inattentional blindness. This happens when focusing on a specific part of an image or a scene renders 
us blind to other elements of that image or scene, even when these elemenets are in the middle of our 
fields of view. We are so focused on a specific task or area of the figure that we never even perceive 
the other elements. There is a fascinating study where researchers showed participants a group of people 
passing a basketball. If you've never tried it, I encourage you to go to [this youtube video][selattention]
and count the number of times that the people in the white shirt pass the basketball, before reading on. 


The participants were asked to count the number of times that the people in the 
video wearing white shirts passed the ball. Unbeknownst to the participants, a person in a gorilla costume 
walks through the video. When asked whether they saw anything unusual in the video, an astonishingly 
large number of them never saw the gorilla walking through the video, because they were entirely 
preoccupied with tracking the basketball and figuring out whether it was currently held by a person in a 
white or a black shirt.   

This has led to the hypothesis above that **there is no perception without attention**. Guiding attention 
is important to ensuring that the viewer perceives the information on display accurately, and takes away 
the key points. Elements to which the viewer is never guided might simply never be registered. So as a 
general guideline, don't encode important information in these elements, because they might not be 
perceived or remembered!

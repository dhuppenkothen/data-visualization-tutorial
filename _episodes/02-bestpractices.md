In the introduction, you got a first idea of the kinds of things we'll be talking about. 
But I've also mentioned that you have likely all seen data visualizations of one form 
or another in your lives. Because reading and interpreting data visualizations is fairly 
closely tied to perception, you already have some understanding of what makes a good 
representation of information.

So we're going to delve right in with an exercise.

> ## Interpreting Data Visualizations
>
> Let's start with two examples of data visualizations.
> The first comes from USA Today, and describes the number of glasses of 
> water adults drink per day:
> 
> ![infographic with bar chart inside a water glass, with labels "0-1: 10%", "2-3: 29%", "4-5: 29%", "6-7: 14%", "8+: 18%"]({{ page.root }}/fig/water_drinking.jpg) 
>
> The second visualization comes from the New York Times, and shows how often the Northern hemisphere 
> experienced certain temperatures, compared to a base period (this is actually a screenshot of 
> an interactive visualization):
> 
> ![histogram of summer temperatures in the Northern hemisphere in 2005-2015,
 going from "cold", "normal", "hot" to "extremely hot"; maximum is in "hot" temperatures, 
 compared to base period (1951-1980), where the maximum is in "normal" ]({{ page.root }}/fig/temperatures.png)
>
>
> For this exercise, pick one of the two data visualizations, then look at the questions below and 
> note down some observations.
>
> 1. What do you think is the main point or piece of information this visualization is trying to convey?
> 2. What elements of the visualization help you understand the information that is being conveyed?
> 3. What elements would you change or improve in order to make the meaning clearer?
>
> When you've written down your observations, find someone in the room who picked the other 
> visualization. Compare your notes: 
> 
> 4. Can you distill general guidelines for designing good data visualizations?
>
> Find another group of 2 and together, collect all your general guidelines and share them with 
> the group in [this document](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/ata-dataviz-exercise1).

Well done! I am going to bet that together, you came up with a pretty comprehensive list of
best practices! Now let's delve a little deeper into those principles, and *why* they work.

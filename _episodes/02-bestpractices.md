title: "What makes a visualization effective? Co-creating best practices"
teaching: 5
exercises: 35
questions:
- "What makes a data visualization effective at communicating information?"
objectives:
- "Critically engaging with the way data is presented visually"
- "Articulating what parts of the visualization are effective, and which ones aren't"
- "Distilling general rules for creating or modifying visual representations of data."
- "Familiarizing learners with design practices like wireframing"

keypoints:
- "All of us have interacted with visualizations in one form or another."
- "Use examples of data visualizations to co-create best practices."

In the introduction, you got a first idea of the kinds of things we'll be talking about. 
But I've also mentioned that you have likely all seen data visualizations of one form 
or another in your lives. Because reading and interpreting data visualizations is fairly 
closely tied to perception, you already have some understanding of what makes a good 
representation of information.

So we're going to delve right in with an exercise.

> ## Interpreting Data Visualizations
>
> Let's start with two examples of data visualizations.
> The first comes from USA Today, and describes the number of glasses of 
> water adults drink per day:
> 
> ![infographic with bar chart inside a water glass, with labels "0-1: 10%", "2-3: 29%", "4-5: 29%", "6-7: 14%", "8+: 18%"]({{ page.root }}/fig/water_drinking.jpg) 
>
> The second visualization comes from the New York Times, and shows how often the Northern hemisphere 
> experienced certain temperatures, compared to a base period (this is actually a screenshot of 
> an interactive visualization):
> 
> ![histogram of summer temperatures in the Northern hemisphere in 2005-2015,
 going from "cold", "normal", "hot" to "extremely hot"; maximum is in "hot" temperatures, 
 compared to base period (1951-1980), where the maximum is in "normal" ]({{ page.root }}/fig/temperatures.png)

>
> For this exercise, pick one of the two data visualizations, then look at the questions below and 
> note down some observations. Take 5 minutes for this task.
>
> 1. What do you think is the main point or piece of information this visualization is trying to convey?
> 2. What elements of the visualization help you understand the information that is being conveyed?
> 3. What elements would you change or improve in order to make the meaning clearer?
>
> When you've written down your observations, find someone in the room who picked the other 
> visualization. Compare your notes (take 10 minutes for this task): 
> 
> 4. Can you distill general guidelines for designing good data visualizations?
>
> Find another group of 2 and together, collect all your general guidelines and share them with 
> the group in [this document](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/ata-dataviz-exercise1) (15 minutes).
>
> **Important**: Make sure you look at the best practices for working in a group below, and keep 
> them in mind when sharing ideas in your groups!
>
> In the last 10 minutes of this exercise, we will discuss the co-created guidelines and best 
> practices together as a group.

Well done! I am going to bet that together, you came up with a pretty comprehensive list of
best practices! Now let's delve a little deeper into those principles, and *why* they work.

> ## Best Practices for Group Exercises
>
> * **Share space and time**: All of our exercises are time-bounded. That means you are all 
> collectively responsible for making sure everyone in your group gets a chance to participate. 
> Keep this in mind when sharing ideas and discussing projects!
> * **Listen to each other**: Give each other space to speak, without interrupting or talking 
> over who is currently speaking. If someone tends to monopolize time, gently remind them 
> to share the time
> * **Encourage one another**: Everyone here comes to this tutorial with a different background 
> and different experiences. Some of you might have learned about this topic before, others might 
> not. Invite especially the junior members of your group to participate, but don't put anyone 
> on the spot, and appreciate the experiences that everyone brings to the table. 
> * **Use positive and inclusive language**: Avoid value judgments in your language, like "this 
> is stupid" or "I can't believe you don't know this". These statements are exclusionary, and 
> not helpful! There are other subtle language cues that sound harmless, but might make it harder 
> for your group members to participate, like "This is easy" or "simple", or "You can *just* [...]".
> Be on the lookout for that language.
> * **It's okay to slip up**: Slip-ups will happen. If someone calls you out, thank them for their 
> feedback, move on and do better next time!

title: "Choosing a Type of Visualization"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What is the difference between continuous, categorical, nominal, ordinal, and proportional data, and how
do these different data types affect our choice of visualization?"
keypoints:
- "Be careful to tailor your choice of visualization to the type of data and the type of information you
are trying to convey"
- "Pie charts only work for parts-to-whole relationships, i.e. proportional data"
- "If relative differences are important in line charts, including the zero-point can be misleading."
- "In bar charts, the area of the bar is proportional to the value displayed, thus leaving out the zero
point in these types of charts can lead to confusion."

In the previous sections, you have learned a lot about the different concepts that help us design good
visualizations, like colour and space, and you have been introduced to the cognitive and psychological
concepts that help us design easy-to-read visualizations, like pre-attentive processes and Gestalt
psychology.

But all of that does not answer one very important question: **How do we pick the right type of 
visualization for our data set?**

Let's explore this question using an example. Below is a plot showing the average long distance
trip length in miles for Thanksgiving (a US holiday), Christmas, and the rest of the year:

title: "Choosing a Type of Visualizationy"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What is the difference between continuous, categorical, nominal, ordinal, and proportional data, and how
do these different data types affect our choice of visualization?"
keypoints:
- "Be careful to tailor your choice of visualization to the type of data and the type of information you
are trying to convey"
- "Pie charts only work for parts-to-whole relationships, i.e. proportional data"
- "If relative differences are important in line charts, including the zero-point can be misleading."
- "In bar charts, the area of the bar is proportional to the value displayed, thus leaving out the zero
point in these types of charts can lead to confusion."

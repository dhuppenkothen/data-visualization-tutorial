In the episode on visual processing, we have learned that colour is one of the strongest 
pre-attentive discriminators. Certainly, colour is one of the most common ways to distinguish 
different elements and to highlight important information. Much has been written about the use 
and mis-use of colour in visualization. 

When designing the colour information for your visualization, there are three important questions 
to keep in mind:

It isn't enough to choose a good, descriptive colour palette. One important consideration is whether 
your different colours interfere with one another and cause visual confusion. But also, you need to 
keep in mind that not everyone will see the same figure as you, on the same type of screen.
Many readers prefer to print out documents, and often these documents are printed in black and white 
only. An element that pops right into your attention on the screen because of its distinctive colour 
might be completely indistiguishable on black-and-white printed paper. Similarly, we have already talked 
about designing for accessibility, and making your visualizations friendly to readers who are 
colour-blind is an important design consideration.

## Hue, Luminance and Saturation

Before we go into the details of how to choose colours, let's start with a little bit of colour theory.
"Colour" does not actually refer to a single thing. Instead, it generally refers to a combination of 
three quantities: hue, luminance and saturation. 

Hue essentially describes what we generally think of as colours: whether something is red or green or 
blue or orange. It describes all the tones of the rainbow, from red to violet. Luminance, on the other 
hand, refers to the "brightness" of the colour. Imagine a red surface, illuminated by a light. If that 
light is dim, the red surface will appear nearly black. As you increase the intensity of the light, 
the surface will turn more and more red. If you make your light *incredibly* bright, then almost all 
of it will be reflected into your eyes, and the surface will appear nearly white. That is luminance.
Saturation, finally, refers to the vibrancy of the colour. Low saturation means your colour is "bleached 
out" and mostly grey. A colour with high saturation will be vibrant and bright. Together, these three 
elements make up the entire colour spectrum you can produce with a computer.

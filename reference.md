## Additional Resources

This section collects a number of additional resources about data visualizations. 

* Edward Tufte's book "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" is a classic staple of 
data visualization. it is often available used in second-hand bookstores and well worth a read.
* Colin Ware "Information Visualization: Perception for Design" is a great in-depth textbook on 
how cognition and perception interact with design. It *is* a textbook, though, so Takes 
some dedication to read. It makes a pretty good reference, too.
* Nature Methods published a series of short articles on data visualization, here's the whole 
[collection][nmviz]. I don't know whether they're freely available, though.
* ["Calling Bullshit"][bullshit], a class taught at the University of Washington by Carl Bergstrom and 
Jevin West, has a number of videos and texts about data visualization, which are free and great 
* Healy + Enns wrote a great [summary paper][healypdf] on pre-attentive processing, which is accessible to 
people who aren't visualization researchers and worth a read
* The Psychological Bulleting published two reviews on Gestalt Psychology in 2012, with the 
[first part][gestalt1] focusing on perceptual grouping and figure-ground organization, and the
[second part][gestalt2] covers modern developments regarding the generaul conceptual and theoretical 
frameworks that underlie Gestalt ideas.]

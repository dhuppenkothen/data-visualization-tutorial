This lesson gives a basic introduction into data visualization. The first part requires no 
computer. The second (supplementary) part includes a walkthrough of generating a descriptive 
visualization. 

It is based on the lesson template used in [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
